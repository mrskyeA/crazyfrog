# Humble Beginnings (pt. 1)

It all started in 1997 when a 17-year-old kid named Daniel Malmedahl noticed that he could imitate a two-stroke engine sound. (Wilson, 2005) He and his friends found it very amusing and posted it online. In 2003, Erik Wernquist an animator at Kaktus Film in Sweden was emailed the humorous sound by a friend and inspired to base creation on it. In an interview with hitquarters.com, “I wanted to create a character that looked like he could sound like that sound…” He modeled and animated over 6 - 8 weeks creating the character we know now. The animation was paired with the aforementioned two-stroke engine sound. It was uploaded to cgitalk.com(a forum website focusing on 3d animation) forums under the name of the Annoying Thing. It instantly became highly popular on the forums and through peer-to-peer file-sharing programs. For a while that was it until 2004, someone at Jamba (a german ringtone company) contacted Erik Wernquist for the rights to use the Annoying Thing for ringtones in exchange for royalties(unknown amount). Quickly they also contacted Daniel Malmedahl — the 17-year-old kid who made the two-stroke engine sound from earlier — and also formed a deal with him.  (Blumentrath & Wernquist, 2005) Jamba rebranded the character as the Crazy Frog and sold the original two-stroke engine sound among a ringtone set with lots of marketing material to promote the entire ringtone set. Funnily, the marketing was so good it became obnoxious to viewers. According to Manchester News(2005), “[People] thought the [Crazy Frog] and his accompanying tune were on screen too often - or found it simply ‘annoying’.”

Eventually the Crazy Frog character became so popular it was practically the face of cellphone ringtones. Due to the newfound popularity of the Crazy Frog character, executives at Jamba decided to combine the most popular cell phone character with the most popular ringtone Axel F. In collaboration with Wolfgang Boss, Reinhard Raith and Henning Reith of the Bass Bumpers they created a remix of Axel F with the sounds of Daniel Malmedahl. They released the cover of Harold Faltermeyer’s Axel F on March 1, 2005. Instantly the song and music video accompanying it gained *add stats* Currently the Axel F video has *blabla views on youtube* Due to this enormous success the rightsholder*insert* decided to create a slew of songs,games, and all sorts of media featuring the character.
