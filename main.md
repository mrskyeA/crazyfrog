# **Crazy Frog**

The biography of the frog and the minds behind him

---

# Intro

“Ring ding ding bem bem,” have you ever heard these words while crossing the street? Maybe you heard it in the car or on the school bus, or you found it on YouTube. Either way that’s not important, what is important is that you have heard the Crazy Frog. Starting in the late 90s and becoming popular in the 2000’s with his ringtone,  this frog has spanned decades with many original hits, cover songs, and games.
